# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

This project analyzes and predicts hourly bike-sharing demand using regression and classification models. The dataset includes weather conditions, time, and user counts.

## Objective
- Predict the number of bike users (regression).
- Classify user count into low/medium/high (classification).

## Methods
- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVC, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² (regression) and Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall (classification).
- Techniques: Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, time segmentation, and ensemble models.

## Files
- `Capstone3.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full analysis.
- `best_model.pkl`: Saved model file.
- `README.md`: Project introduction (this file).
